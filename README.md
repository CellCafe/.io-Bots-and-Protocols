# io Bots and Protocols for the .io Bots
All deobfuscated cores to the games I've botted before can be found in the deobfuscated-cores folder.
You can make your own bots using them too.

The bots I've made for games can also be found here. Feel free to edit any code you want. Just leave credits.

If you're having any issues contact me on my discord: Tatsuya#9737 or join my discord server: https://discord.com/invite/bAstbAfem9

If you need any help in any games feel free to contact me there as well.
